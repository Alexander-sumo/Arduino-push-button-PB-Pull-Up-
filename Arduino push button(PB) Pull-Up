// The Goal of the program is to Read the state of a push button connected to pin 5 and print it to the serial monitor. The main Theme is Digital Input/Serial.Begin 
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
// Start serial communication  
Serial.begin(9600);  
// Configure pin 5 as an input with internal pull-up resistor  
pinMode(5, INPUT_PULLUP); 
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
// Read the pushbutton state and make it equal to an int
int sensorVal = digitalRead(5); 
 // Print and Println the button state to the serial monitor  
Serial.print("Button State = "); 
 Serial.println(sensorVal);
}
